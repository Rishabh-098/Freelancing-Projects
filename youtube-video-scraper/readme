🎥 YouTube Video Data Scraper
🌟 Project Overview
This project automates the extraction of video data from a specified YouTube channel and uploads it into a Google Spreadsheet in a custom format daily. Utilizing the YouTube API for scraping and the Google Sheets API for data management, this Python application is later transpiled to JavaScript for deployment on Google Apps Script for scheduled automation.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 
: Primary programming language for scripting.
JavaScript 
: Used in Google Apps Script for automation within Google's infrastructure.
YouTube API 
: For retrieving video metadata.
Google Sheets API 
: For manipulating spreadsheet data.
Google Apps Script 
: For automating daily script execution in the Google cloud platform.
