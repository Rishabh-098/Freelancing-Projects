## Dashboard Overview

The Quality Performance Index dashboard provides an overview of the project's quality metrics, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze the quality performance effectively. It includes the following components:

- **Overall QPI Trends:** Visualizes the trend of the overall Quality Performance Index over time, allowing users to identify patterns and fluctuations.
  
- **QPI by Category:** Breaks down the Quality Performance Index into different categories (e.g., defect types, severity levels) to pinpoint areas requiring improvement.
  
- **Defect Density Analysis:** Analyzes defect density across various stages of the project life cycle, helping in identifying critical phases prone to higher defect occurrences.
  
- **Top Contributors:** Identifies top contributors to quality issues based on various metrics (e.g., number of defects raised, resolved, re-opened).
  
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Provides insights into the root causes of quality issues, aiding in formulating targeted improvement strategies.

## Data Sources

The dashboard utilizes Excel data provided by the company project. The data includes information such as defect types, severity levels, project milestones, and other relevant quality metrics.
